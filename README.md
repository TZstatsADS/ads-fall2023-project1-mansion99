Term: Fall 2023

+ Projec title: Unveiling Happiness Narratives: Are Achievements and Affections the Universal Cornerstones of Joy?

+ Project summary: The aim of selecting "Unveiling Happiness Narratives: Are Achievements and Affections the Universal Cornerstones of Joy?" as the focal point of this data story for the HappyDB dataset is threefold.First,I wanted to better understand the complex interactions between individual accomplishments and affectionate relationships in determining happiness, providing a sophisticated understanding of the stories that people typically identify with joy. Second, it aims to identify any possible gender-specific themes in these sentences, allowing for a greater comprehension of various viewpoints on happiness. Finally, this investigation can help create communities that are more in line with the essential components of pleasure, thereby informing programs and regulations that promote wellbeing on a larger scale.
